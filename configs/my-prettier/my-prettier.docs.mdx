description: Shared Prettier configuration as a component
labels: ['prettier', 'configurations']
---

Use this component in any project to share the same Prettier configuration.

## Instructions

:::note
This is a demo component - in order to create your own, run `bit fork learn-harmony.configs/my-prettier` and apply your own linting rules as required.
Then mirror the instructions below in order to use your shareable config in either a standard workspace or bit environment.
::: 

### Project-level usage

Install this component as a `devDependency` in your project.

```bash
yarn add @learn-harmony/configs.my-prettier --dev
```

```js
module.exports = {
  ...require('@learn-harmony/configs.my-prettier')
  // override what ever you  want eg:
  // tabWidth: 4
};
```

### Bit env usage

In order to use this config in your env's prettier service, add the following code to the env compose/overrides array in the main.runtime.ts file of your env.  
E.g. for a custom react env:

```js
/**
 * override the Prettier default config here the check your formatting
 * @example
 * bit format --check
 * bit format
 */
react.usePrettier({
transformers: [
  (config) => {
    config.raw = { ...config.clone(), ...require('@learn-harmony/configs.my-prettier') }
    config.setKey('tabWidth', 2); // to override or extend the imported config
    return config;
  }
]
}),
```

You can see an example of how to add this by creating a dummy new react env from the template - `bit create react-env my-env` - and then finding the sample usePrettier override in the main.runtime.ts file. 
Note - remember to `bit remove` this dummy env from your workspace when you've finished with it.

## What's included

Basic configuration with exaggerated tab with to easily test it out

```json
