description: Shared ESLint configuration as a component
labels: ['eslint', 'configurations']
---

Use this component in any project to share the same ESLint configuration.

## Instructions

:::note
This is a demo component - in order to create your own, run `bit fork learn-harmony.configs/my-eslint` and apply your own linting rules as required.
Then mirror the instructions below in order to use your shareable config in either a standard workspace or bit environment.
::: 

### Project-level usage

Install this component as a `devDependency` in your project.

```bash
yarn add @learn-bit-react/configs.my-eslint --dev
```

Import this component in your project's ESlint config:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: [require.resolve('@learn-harmony/configs.my-eslint')]
};
```

Add a console.log() statement to one of the files in your project to test it out.

### Bit env usage

In order to use this config in your env's linting service, add the following code to the env compose/overrides array in the main.runtime.ts file of your env.  
E.g. for a custom react env:

```js
/**
 * override the ESLint default config here then check your files for lint errors
 * @example
 * bit lint
 * bit lint --fix
 */
react.useEslint({
transformers: [
  (config) => {
    config.addExtends(require.resolve('@learn-harmony/configs.my-eslint'));
    return config;
  }
]
}),
```

You can see an example of how to add this by creating a dummy new react env from the template - `bit create react-env my-env` - and then finding the sample useEslint in the main.runtime.ts file. 
Note - remember to `bit remove` this dummy env from your workspace when you've finished with it.

## What's included

Basic configuration with a no-console rule.

```json
